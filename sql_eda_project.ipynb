    "- Repository: [datafun-05-sql-project](https://github.com/kiruthikaa2512/datafun-05-sql-project)\n",
    "- Date: June 04, 2025\n",
    "- Purpose: The purpose of this project is to explore and analyze a relational database that tracks technical issues and their corresponding analyses. Using Python and SQL, we aim to uncover patterns, trends, and insights from the structured data to better understand issue frequency, resolution status, and the types of analysis performed. This will demonstrate the integration of SQL with Python for effective data exploration and decision support."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "### Dataset Overview:\n",
    "The dataset contains two related tables â€” issues and analysis. The issues table records software/system issues with details like task ID, description, category, creation date, and status. The analysis table captures root cause analyses linked to issues via task IDs, including analysis type, root causes, resolutions, and resolution dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals:\n",
    "Understand the distribution of issue types, their statuses, root causes, and resolution effectiveness to identify patterns and areas for process improvements."
